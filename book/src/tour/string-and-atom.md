# String & Atom

## Strings

Gleam's Strings are binary strings, the same as Elixir's strings.

```rust,noplaypen
// Gleam
"Hello, Gleam!"
```
```
# Elixir
"Hello, Elixir!"
```
```
% Erlang
<<"Hello, Erlang!">>.
```


## Atoms

Gleam does not currently have first class support for Erlang atoms, though
likely will in future.
