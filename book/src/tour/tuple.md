# Tuples

Tuples are an ordered collection of elements of a fixed size. Each element can
be of a different type.

The syntax for tuples in Gleam is the same as in Elixir and Erlang.

```rust,noplaypen
// Gleam
{1, 2.0, "three"}
```
```
# Elixir
true
{1, 2.0, "three"}
```
```
% Erlang
{1, 2.0, <<"three">>}.
```
